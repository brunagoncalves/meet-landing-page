### What I learned

I gained more experience in structuring responsive layouts.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I aim to further enhance my skills in responsive design by mastering advanced layout techniques like CSS Grid and improving my approach to handling images for various screen sizes. I also want to explore optimizing images for better performance and learn about modern accessibility practices, such as implementing ARIA roles and landmarks for better user experience. Another area of focus will be improving my debugging workflow to efficiently tackle layout issues like overflow and alignment problems.
